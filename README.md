# TODO
- add other methods: reptile, surf, carlos, ...
- update data manager (do not mention BRSEt, remove unecessary functions)
- make a colab notebook as example (based on train.py)
- modularize the train.py (remove hardcoded stuff + add parser) maybe this script wont be in the final version... If colab notebook works fine we dont need this script
- add tutorial about how to configure the `csv` file for custom data
- should gradcam be in this repo???
- Create beautiful and complete README. Can we get a logo such as [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR/)? try using AI for it
